1. Install node.js . 
2. Install create-react-app.
npm install -g create-react-app

Next, I'll create a new React project using create-react-app. I'll navigate to the directory where I want to create my project and run the following command
create-react-app my-app

I'll replace my-app with the name of my project.

Once my project is created, I'll start the development server by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
cd my-app
npm start
Now that my project is set up and the development server is running, I can start coding my app. I'll open my project in a code editor and make changes to the src directory to build my application.

I'll need to install some additional dependencies to get started with building the frontend, such as react-router-dom for implementing routing in the application, axios for making HTTP requests to the API, and react-bootstrap or material-ui for building the UI components.

I'll implement token authentication to secure the application, using JWT tokens. When the user logs in, the API will return a token that will be stored in the browser's local storage or cookie. On subsequent API requests, the token will be sent in the request headers for validation.

I'll build the user interface by creating components for each of the views mentioned in the requirements. I'll use React Router to handle routing between the views, and use React Bootstrap or Material UI to style the components.

I'll use Axios to make API requests to the backend API. Each API endpoint will have a corresponding function that can be called from the frontend components.

I'll implement appropriate error handling and validation in the components to provide a smooth user experience.

If I decide to implement the bonus features, I'll create separate components and routes for them. For example, if I decide to implement a search functionality for policies and claims, I'll create a Search component and a corresponding route.

Once I have completed building the application, I'll test it thoroughly to ensure that it meets all the requirements. Once I'm satisfied, I'll deploy the application to a hosting provider of my choice.
